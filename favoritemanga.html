	  <p>Alright starting from number one is Black Clover. Second is Chainsaw Man and in third is Dragonball Z/Super.</p>

	       <p>Black clover is about a world were magic is everything and society is divided with royals and peasants. One day two young boys named Asta and Yuno are dropped off at a church/orphange.</p>
	       <p>As time passes both boys grow up, Yuno gains strong wind magic and Asta has no magic. They both have the same dream of becoming the "wizard king", the highest military position that is looked up by the people in the kingdom.</p>
	       <p>Now Asta knowing he has no magic still pushes to becoming stronger and says his magic is never giving up. Eventually the two head out to get their grimoires(book of spells) and Asta doesn't get his.</p>
	       <p>As more of the plot goes on, Asta does get his grimoire of ant-magic, magic that can cancel out other magic. Sooner or later he joins the magic knights known as the Black Bulls. From there he is faced with many challenges.</p>
	       <p>No matter what he faces his magic is never giving up.</p>

	    <h3>Dragonball Z/Super</h3>
		<p>By Akira Toriyama</p>
	    <img src="images/dragon.jpg" alt="image_Dragonball_Z_/_Super">
	    <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8Ry9f5x3sww" title="Dragon Ball Super Clean Opening 2 V2 [Creditless]  Limit Break x Survivor [Funimation BD-Rip]" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
	    <p>Dragonball is one of the longest series I have read because it has about three expansions to it's story. The first being Dragonball then Dragonball Z and now in the recent story being Dragonball Super.</p>
	    <p>Dragonball Z and Super kind of have the same story built plot. Like there is a new arc with a new villian and the fighters have to defeat them. Its the fights that make the story really good.</p>
	    <p>The main character is Goku he is from an alien race called the sayians and was to be the very few to survive the sayian's extinction. He was sent off the planet when he was a baby and was taken in by an old man named Gohan.</p>
	    <p>He was belived to be born human for a long time, but once his brother found him and kidnapped his son. He was told that he wasn't human, but a race of brutal warriors that take and enslave other planets.</p>
	    <p>Goku is a well trained fighter and would do anything to protect his home planet Earth. Later on in Dragonball Z he gained a form called Super Sayian that was to be belived to be a myth in his race's history.</p>
	    <p>There are many more arcs that the story of Goku goes through and this leads into Dragonball Super. Where Goku is facing more stronger foes then the last and he is doing all this to protect his home and friends.</p>
